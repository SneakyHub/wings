# SneakyPanel Wings

**SneakyPanel Wings** serves as the server control plane, meticulously crafted for the dynamic gaming industry. It is designed to be highly efficient and secure, offering an HTTP API that allows direct interaction with running server instances. Users can easily fetch server logs, generate backups, and manage all aspects of the server lifecycle seamlessly.

Additionally, Wings comes equipped with a built-in SFTP server, ensuring your system remains free of SneakyPanel-specific dependencies, while allowing users to authenticate using the same credentials they normally use to access the Panel.
